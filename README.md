# snake-and-commits

Your GitHub contribution graph, but it's a real game of Snake.

![snake eating a contribution graph](assets/demo.svg)

The snake plays an actual, winnable game. It hunts every commit cell with real
pathfinding, never crosses its own body, grows one segment per cell it eats,
fades from a bright head to a dim tail, and counts the commits it swallows. Pure
animated SVG (CSS, no JavaScript), so it renders anywhere GitHub shows an image.

- 🐍 **Real Snake AI**: BFS pathfinding, self-collision avoidance, tail-chasing when boxed in
- 🍎 **Eats your commits**: each contribution cell is food, with a live counter
- 📈 **Grows as it eats**: starts at 3 segments, gains one per cell, head-to-tail gradient
- 🎨 **Themeable**: `green` (default), `blue`, `amber`, `matrix`
- 🪶 **Zero dependencies**: one standard-library Python file
- ♿ **Respects `prefers-reduced-motion`**: falls back to a static graph

## Quickstart

Add one workflow to your profile repo (the repo named after your username).
Create `.github/workflows/snake.yml`:

```yaml
name: snake
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: "0 */12 * * *"   # twice a day
  workflow_dispatch:
permissions:
  contents: write
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: dahan8473/snake-and-commits@v1
        with:
          github_user: ${{ github.repository_owner }}
          output: dist/snake.svg
          theme: green
      - uses: crazy-max/ghaction-github-pages@v4
        with:
          target_branch: output
          build_dir: dist
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ github.token }}
```

Run it once from the Actions tab, then add this to your `README.md`:

```md
![snake](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YOUR_NAME/YOUR_NAME/output/snake.svg)
```

It regenerates on schedule from your live contribution data.

### Light and dark

Generate two themes and switch with `<picture>`:

```md
<picture>
  <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"  srcset=".../output/snake-dark.svg">
  <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: light)" srcset=".../output/snake-light.svg">
  <img src=".../output/snake-dark.svg" alt="contribution snake">
</picture>
```

## Options

| input | default | description |
|---|---|---|
| `github_user` | required | whose graph to render (usually `${{ github.repository_owner }}`) |
| `output` | `dist/snake.svg` | output path |
| `theme` | `green` | `green`, `blue`, `amber`, `matrix` |
| `frame` | `false` | draw a rounded window frame around the graph |
| `counter` | `true` | show the `commits eaten: n/total` counter |

## Themes

| theme | look |
|---|---|
| 🟩 `green` | native GitHub |
| 🟦 `blue` | phosphor terminal |
| 🟧 `amber` | old CRT |
| ⬛ `matrix` | bright-on-black |

## Run locally

```bash
GH_TOKEN=$(gh auth token) python3 generate.py --user YOUR_NAME --output snake.svg --theme green
```

One file, standard library only. Any token that can read public contribution
data works.

## How it works

1. Pull a year of contribution levels from the GitHub GraphQL API.
2. Solve the board like a Snake game. From a corner, BFS to the nearest commit
   cell (sparsest first), always avoiding the body. If the best target is walled
   off, chase the tail until space opens. The route is collision-free, and the
   max length is auto-tuned to the largest snake that still clears the board.
3. Render it as a cell-state animation. Each grid square animates its own fill:
   bright when the head enters, fading down the body, back to background as the
   tail passes. Nothing moves, so segments can never overlap.
